				FORMER EMPLOYMENT
			</h2>
			<h4>
				Water World - Guest Services
			</h4>
			<p>
				   I worked at the largest water park in Colorado -  Water World - in the Guest Services department during the summer of 2016. During this time I closely worked with guests and helped them with their concerns and checking bags at the front gate. At the end of the Summer due to me never missing a shift or being late, I was given a Labor Day bonus.<br><br>

			<h4>
				Water World - Lifeguard
			</h4>
			<p>
				   During the summer of 2017 and 2018, I worked at Water World as a lifeguard, meaning that I worked in most of the attractions at the park, helping run them as well as making sure people stayed safe. I also was responsible for watching the big wave pools, monitoring the water for guests in distress. Over the course of the two summers, I jumped in the water a total of 21 times to save guests ranging from toddlers to fully-grown adults.<br><br>

			<h4>
				Filing Assistant for Clark Dray - Bankruptcy Lawyer
			</h4>
			<p>
				    Over the summer of 2017, I worked on Thursdays and Fridays for a bankruptcy lawyer named Clark Dray. During this time, I handled sensitive and confidential documents and helped organize them into his firmâ€™s databases. This gave me really good experience working with information and learning how an office works.<br><br>

			<h4>
				Cafe Rio - Line Cook/Dishwasher/Delivery Driver
			</h4>
			<p>
				    From November 2018 to September 2019, I worked as an employee for Cafe Rio Mexican Grill and quickly learned all the positions in the restaurant. When I turned 18 May of 2019, my boss trained me on how to deliver catering orders to our customers, and I successfully completed over 100 caterings during that time. We also participated with Foodsby, a service that allows office workers from different companies to order food from our restaurant with us delivering it to them (similar to Door Dash or Uber Eats). This meant that I often would deliver 20+ meals as well as a catering order all in one day. 
		    		Following my return from my mission abroad in October 2021, I resumed this former job and took another few dozen catering jobs and also worked as the dishwasher until December.<br><br>

			<h4>

				ACTIVITIES AND LEADERSHIP
			</h2>
			<h4>
				Mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - October 2019 - 2021
			</h4>
			<p>
				From October 2019-2021 I served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Adriatic North Mission. During this time I became fluent in Croatian, Serbian, and Bosnian and lived for at least a few months in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, and Montenegro. While there, I served in many capacities including clerk, branch president, and translator. I grew in leadership skills and also in interpersonal communication with the local church membership as well as other Balkan natives.

			<h4>
				Starting Varsity Left Tackle for Horizon High School Football Team - August - November 2018
			</h4>
			<p>
				I played American Football as an offensive lineman during my junior and senior years of high school. I had never played sports before, but thoroughly enjoyed it and was quite an accomplished athlete by the end.<br>
				By the end of my first (and only) Varsity season, I had started in every single game, lettered, and was named Second Team All-Conference as well as Offensive Line MVP.
			</p>
			<h4>Theater/Drama - August 2016 - May 2019
			</h4>
			<p>
				For the entirety of my time in high school I have participated in at least one major production every year, working on props and tech as well as acting. I had major roles in three different productions: I played Gandalf the Wizard in our play The Hobbit, The Wizard of Oz in the play of the same name, and as the prince, in the play Romeo and Juliet. I served for a time as the treasurer of the Thespian Society at my school as well.
